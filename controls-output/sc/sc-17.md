{: note}


## Control requirements
{: #control-requirements}

SC-17 - 0
    : The organization issues public key certificates under an [IBM Assignment: organization-defined certificate policy in accordance with the Supplemental Guidance for Cryptography Governance] or obtains public key certificates from an approved service provider.

## Additional IBM Cloud for Financial Services specifications
{: #additional-ibm-cloud-for-financial-services-specifications}

The organization must implement certificate management processes including:
- Obtaining certificates from a customer-approved service provider / certificate authority
- Issued certificates must identify allowed key operations
- Certificates must only be used in accordance with key attributes as specified within the certificate
- A new key pair must be created, and another certificate obtained when a certificate is becomes invalid

## NIST supplemental guidance
{: #nist-supplemental-guidance}

For all certificates, organizations manage information system trust stores to ensure only approved trust anchors are in the trust stores. This control addresses both certificates with visibility external to organizational information systems and certificates related to the internal operations of systems, for example, application-specific time services.
