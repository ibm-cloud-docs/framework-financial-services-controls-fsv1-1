{: note}


## Control requirements
{: #control-requirements}

The organization:

MP-4 (a)
    : Physically controls and securely stores _[IBM Assignment: all types of digital and non-digital media with sensitive information]_ within _[Assignment: organization-defined controlled areas]_; and

MP-4 (b)
    : Protects information system media until the media are destroyed or sanitized using approved equipment, techniques, and procedures.

## NIST supplemental guidance
{: #nist-supplemental-guidance}

Information system media includes both digital and non-digital media. Digital media includes, for example, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard disk drives, flash drives, compact disks, and digital video disks. Non-digital media includes, for example, paper and microfilm. Physically controlling information system media includes, for example, conducting inventories, ensuring procedures are in place to allow individuals to check out and return media to the media library, and maintaining accountability for all stored media. Secure storage includes, for example, a locked drawer, desk, or cabinet, or a controlled media library. The type of media storage is commensurate with the security category and/or classification of the information residing on the media. Controlled areas are areas for which organizations provide sufficient physical and procedural safeguards to meet the requirements established for protecting information and/or information systems. For media containing information determined by organizations to be in the public domain, to be publicly releasable, or to have limited or no adverse impact on organizations or individuals if accessed by other than authorized personnel, fewer safeguards may be needed. In these situations, physical access controls provide adequate protection.
