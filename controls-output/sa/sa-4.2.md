# SA-4 (2) - Design / Implementation Information for Security Controls [FSv1.1]
{: #sa-4.2}

This control is based on IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services v1.1.

SA-4 (2) - 0
    : The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to provide design and implementation information for the security controls to be employed that includes: [Selection (one or more): security-relevant external system interfaces; high-level design; low-level design; source code or hardware schematics;  [Assignment: organization-defined design/implementation information] ] at [Assignment: organization-defined level of detail].

## NIST supplemental guidance
{: #nist-supplemental-guidance}

Organizations may require different levels of detail in design and implementation documentation for security controls employed in organizational information systems, system components, or information system services based on mission/business requirements, requirements for trustworthiness/resiliency, and requirements for analysis and testing. Information systems can be partitioned into multiple subsystems. Each subsystem within the system can contain one or more modules. The high-level design for the system is expressed in terms of multiple subsystems and the interfaces between subsystems providing security-relevant functionality. The low-level design for the system is expressed in terms of modules with particular emphasis on software and firmware (but not excluding hardware) and the interfaces between modules providing security-relevant functionality. Source code and hardware schematics are typically referred to as the implementation representation of the information system.
