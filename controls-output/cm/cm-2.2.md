# CM-2 (2) - Automation Support for Accuracy / Currency [FSv1.1]
{: #cm-2.2}

This control is based on IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services v1.1.
{: note}


## Control requirements
{: #control-requirements}

CM-2 (2) - 0
    : The organization employs automated mechanisms to maintain an up-to-date, complete, accurate, and readily available baseline configuration of the information system.

## Implementation guidance

See the resources that follow to learn more about how to implement this control.

- [Compliance monitoring](/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-monitoring-compliance)

## IBM Cloud for Financial Services profile
{: #scc-fs-cloud-profile}

The rules related to this control that follow are part of the IBM Cloud for Financial Services v1.2.0 profile in [{{site.data.keyword.compliance_full}}](/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-getting-started).

- Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain collects software bills of materials (SBOM) to provide transparency in build artifacts 
- Check whether DevSecOps Toolchain deployment has approved change documentation including security impact analysis

## NIST supplemental guidance
{: #nist-supplemental-guidance}

Automated mechanisms that help organizations maintain consistent baseline configurations for information systems include, for example, hardware and software inventory tools, configuration management tools, and network management tools. Such tools can be deployed and/or allocated as common controls, at the information system level, or at the operating system or component level (e.g., on workstations, servers, notebook computers, network components, or mobile devices). Tools can be used, for example, to track version numbers on operating system applications, types of software installed, and current patch levels. This control enhancement can be satisfied by the implementation of CM-8 (2) for organizations that choose to combine information system component inventory and baseline configuration activities.
