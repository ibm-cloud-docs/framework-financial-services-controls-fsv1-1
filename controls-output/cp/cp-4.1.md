## Control requirements
{: #control-requirements}

CP-4 (1) - 0
    : The organization coordinates contingency plan testing with organizational elements responsible for related plans.

## Additional IBM Cloud for Financial Services specifications
{: #additional-ibm-cloud-for-financial-services-specifications}

- To ensure response times can be met, testing must be performed by all appropriate parties, including response teams, executives, management, and 3rd/4th party resources as needed.

## NIST supplemental guidance
{: #nist-supplemental-guidance}

Plans related to contingency plans for organizational information systems include, for example, Business Continuity Plans, Disaster Recovery Plans, Continuity of Operations Plans, Crisis Communications Plans, Critical Infrastructure Plans, Cyber Incident Response Plans, and Occupant Emergency Plans. This control enhancement does not require organizations to create organizational elements to handle related plans or to align such elements with specific plans. It does require, however, that if such organizational elements are responsible for related plans, organizations should coordinate with those elements.
